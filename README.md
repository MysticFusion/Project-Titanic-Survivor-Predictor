## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction App allows users to enter passenger details (such as age, sex, class, fare, etc.) and receive a real-time prediction about their survival odds on the Titanic. This beginner-to-intermediate project showcases classification modeling, web interface creation, and user-friendly deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Develop a supervised ML model to predict survival of Titanic passengers.
- Apply the full data science workflow: data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation.
- Create a web-based interface using Streamlit for real-time prediction.
- Package the project to be portable and runnable with a single command.
- Optionally deploy the model for public use online (Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces).
